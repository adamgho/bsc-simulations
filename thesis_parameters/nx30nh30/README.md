# Simulations with 30 X and 30 H

I ran these on 1000 DAGs with 30 X and 30 H, except for the
simulations in stor 4, were only 100 DAGs where used.

Don't run ICP and PICP for these setting. They are very slow, and all the
p-values become 1 due to Bonferroni correction for the large number of variables.
